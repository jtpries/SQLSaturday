# SQLSaturday
 This is a C# console application which will connect to the SQL Saturday (sqlsaturday.com) public website to download event data and store it in a SQL Server database.  Once the data is loaded and cleansed in the database, it is loaded into a Power BI Report for visualization and analysis.
